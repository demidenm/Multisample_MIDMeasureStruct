When running first level, run FirstLevel.sh first
Make sure FirstLevel.py and FixedEffect.py ses = ses-1

Then run FirstLevel_2.sh
Make sure FirstLevel.py and FixedEffet.py  ses = ses-2


This is because some subjects did not have initial reward task until a later session.
MLS treated these subjects as the ses-1. So following their standard here.
They have 2+ waves of data, here we use only 2 but adopt this practice per
advice from Mary Soules from Dr Mary Heitzeg's lab.
